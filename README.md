# A View Into The GrowHaus
This application is intended to provide a view into The GrowHaus' market data. Market data is scraped from html reports generated by the market's POS system. (This is unfortunately the most effective way to access this data.) 

The application is currently deployed [here](https://intense-sea-51551.herokuapp.com/).

__Note:__ This application is currently being refactored. The latest version has yet to be deployed.  

## Usage
At the time of this writting, the application may be used to search transaction history for transactions between a specified date range for a specific user or user type.  

Total market volume is graphed with a simple line chart. 

More robust querying features and visualizations are in development.
